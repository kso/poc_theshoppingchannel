# search and product recommendations.  Include navigationFields to define
# which navigation options should be used for navigation search.

# Fields specified by searchField are used for auto complete. In addition,
# a weight can be given to terms found in each specified field. This can
# be done by adding a number, separated by a comma, after the field name.
# If weight is not set, the weight defaults to 1. Please note, these fields are
# broken into every possible three word n-gram and this will generate a
# lot of data. Autocomplete could become unresponsive if not used with care.
# Decide which fields are most important to your user experience.

# A language field can be specified to switch between character-based (for languages such as Thai,
# Chinese, Korean or Japanese) and the default (word-based) processing. Records with supported
# character-based languages will generate terms from all defined searchFields by splitting on
# characters rather than by words. Please refer the documentation for a list of supported languages.
# Please note, The "lang_" prefix is optional. For example, the field value can either be "lang_en"
# or "en". If the language provided in the field is not recognized, the default word-based processing
# is used.

# By default, all the fields specified here are returned by the SAYT product search endpoint. As the endpoint is not secure
# (does not require your client key to query) it is imperative that this "field" parameter is used to 
# tell the service which data should be returned in the allMeta section.  More than one field can be defined.
